# cancer_proteogenomics
We are looking at post-translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation, acetylation, etc.) sites that exhibit a normal distribution of mutation frequencies in cancer, exhibit 3D mutational hotspots, and/or reside in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and phase separation (PS) regions.
